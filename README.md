# CIFAR-10
* Image Classification with CIFAR-10: Implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.
* Deep Learning Model: Builds a custom CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract visual features.
* Training & Evaluation: Trains the model with GPU support, tracks accuracy and loss over epochs, and evaluates performance on the test set.
* Visualization: Includes visualizations of sample images, training progress, and model predictions to aid interpretability.
